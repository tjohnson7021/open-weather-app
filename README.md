 Open Weather API sandbox webapp

# Project Overview

Description: open-weather-app is a simple full-stack web application that allows users to retrieve weather forecast data based on a provided ZIP code. The application features a Node.js backend powered by Express and TypeScript, and a frontend built with React, Vite, and TypeScript. The backend interacts with the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather information, while the frontend displays this data in a user-friendly manner.

Technical Stack
Backend:

Node.js: Utilized for building the server, leveraging its event-driven, non-blocking architecture for efficient request handling.
TypeScript: Employed to enhance code quality with static typing, improving maintainability and minimizing runtime errors.
Express.js: Used to create a RESTful API that simplifies routing and middleware management.
Frontend:

React: Chosen for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
Vite: Used as a modern build tool, enabling fast development and efficient bundling of assets.
TypeScript: Integrated into the frontend to provide type safety and improve code clarity.
Architecture
Server Architecture: The server exposes a single API endpoint, /weather/:zipcode, which accepts a ZIP code as a URL parameter. It makes a request to the OpenWeather API to retrieve forecast data and returns this information to the client.

Client Architecture: The frontend is built with React components that allow users to input a ZIP code. Upon submission, the client invokes the backend API, receives the weather data, and displays it in an organized format.

Features
API Endpoint:

`GET /weather/:zipcode`: Fetches weather data for the specified ZIP code by querying the OpenWeather API. Returns a standardized format containing temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and more.
User Interface:

An input field for users to enter a desired ZIP code.
A button to submit the request and fetch weather data.
Display of forecast data including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
Challenges and Solutions
API Rate Limiting: Managing API rate limits when querying the OpenWeather API was a concern. Implemented request throttling on the backend to limit the number of requests made per user in a specified timeframe, ensuring compliance with API usage policies.

Data Handling: Structuring and properly formatting the data retrieved from the OpenWeather API to create a clear and user-friendly frontend presentation. Employed TypeScript interfaces to define expected data structures, ensuring type safety and improving code maintainability.

Future Enhancements
Extended Functionality: Potential enhancements include:
Adding support for multiple ZIP codes at once to compare weather across different locations.
Implementing user accounts to save favorite locations and view their weather forecasts.
Adding additional weather metrics and visualizations (e.g., graphs for temperature trends).
Implementing error handling and user notifications for invalid ZIP codes or API errors.
