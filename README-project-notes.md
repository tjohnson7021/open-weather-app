- It's up and running!! https://tjohnson7021.github.io/open-weather-app/
- backend deployed at render.com
- frontend hosted on github pages
- package.json scripts work - unless otherwise noted
- backend and frontend launch separately (by running `npm run dev` in the respective directory)


Up Next
- need to fix front end:
  - figure out how to change units from °C to °F
  - figure out how data from the API call is translated to the React frontend
  - redesign weather card
  - redesign weather forecast page
